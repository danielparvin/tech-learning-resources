# Tech Learning Resources
These are some of my favorite tech learning resources!

## Java
[Effective Java, Third Edition by Joshua Bloch](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9780134686097/)   
This is an outstanding resource on best practices in Java development (through Java 9). It's a good book to discuss with team members. Having developed many of the core Java APIs himself, the author shares practical, insightful recommendations on how (and whether) to use a given feature of the platform. The author organizes the book into general categories such as _Creating and Destroying Objects_, _Generics_, and _Concurrency_. Within each category, the author includes a number of individual items like _Check parameters for validity_ and _Make defensive copies when needed_. Each item is two- to eight-pages long and includes best-practice recommendations on both _what_ to do and _why_ to do so.   

[The Well-Grounded Java Developer, Second Edition by Martijn Verburg, Benjamin Evans, and Jason Clark](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-well-grounded-java/9781617298875/)   
This is another excellent resource that's conducive to group discussion. I led a department-wide discussion of selected chapters from this book. Published in November 2022, this book contains information on more recent developments in the Java platform through Java 17. It contains an entire chapter on the Java Platform Module System (JPMS), one whole chapter on the new features in Java 17, three chapters on concurrency, and a few chapters on alternative JVM languages (Kotlin and Clojure).

[Parallel and Concurrent Programming with Java by Olivia Chiu Stone and Barron Stone](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/parallel-and-concurrent-programming-with-java-1)   
This is a two-part LinkedIn Learning video course. It is, surprisingly, as entertaining as it is informative! The husband-and-wife pair interact in fun and memorable ways, introducing key concurrency concepts and relevant Java APIs in relatable, accessible ways. (I have yet to complete the second part of this series.)

## Python
[NumPy Essential Training: 1 Foundations of NumPy by Terezija Semenski](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/numpy-essential-training-1-foundations-of-numpy)   
This video course on LinkedIn Learning is less than ninety minutes long, but is packed with helpful, introductory information on the basics of NumPy. The teacher is clear and methodical. The subsequent course, [NumPy Essential Training: 2 MatPlotlib and Linear Algebra Capabilities](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/numpy-essential-training-2-matplotlib-and-linear-algebra-capabilities), introduces additional material that builds on the basics.

## Databases
Database Foundations series by Adam Wilbert   
This series of courses on LinkedIn Learning is amazing. I'm so glad that this was available to me when I first started learning relational databases. (The instructor started releasing these courses in November 2020, and I found and started completing them a few months later.) I've completed a few dozen courses on LinkedIn Learning, and this series is definitely among the best on the platform. The content is very well paced within the whole series and within each course. The instructor is clear and thorough in describing concepts and in providing what learners need to succeed. The series includes these indvidual courses:
- [Database Foundations: Intro to Databases](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/database-foundations-intro-to-databases)
- [Database Foundations: Data Structures](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/database-foundations-data-structures)
- [Database Foundations: Database Management](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/database-foundations-database-management)
- [Database Foundations: Administration](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/database-foundations-administration-8375189)
- [Database Foundations: Application Development](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/database-foundations-application-development)

[PostgreSQL: Client Applications by Adam Wilbert](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/postgresql-client-applications/work-with-postgresql-on-the-command-line)   
This is an in-depth exploration of psql on LinkedIn Learning by the author of the Database Foundations series. In addition to providing a review of basic psql usage, the instructor helps learners streamline their use of psql through customization, and he highlights a few advanced configurations that early intermediate psql users would otherwise overlook. He also expounds on the best ways to use pg_dump and pg_restore with various parameters.

## General/Other
[Designing RESTful APIs by Keith Casey](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/designing-restful-apis/design-a-restful-api-for-your-organization)   
In this LinkedIn Learning course, the author introduces and discusses best practices for REST API design. He shares insights concerning basic design considerations including appropriate endpoint names, HTTP methods, and URL parameters. He also spends some time explaining how to version and update a REST API.
