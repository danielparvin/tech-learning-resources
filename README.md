# Tech Learning Resources
These are some of my favorite tech learning resources!

## Java
[Effective Java, Third Edition by Joshua Bloch](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9780134686097/)   
This is an outstanding resource on best practices in Java development (through Java 9) and is one of my top favorites. It's a good book to discuss with team members. Having developed many of the core Java APIs himself, the author shares practical, insightful recommendations on how (and whether) to use a given feature of the platform. The author organizes the book into general categories such as _Creating and Destroying Objects_, _Generics_, and _Concurrency_. Within each category, the author includes a number of individual items like _Check parameters for validity_ and _Make defensive copies when needed_. Each item is two- to eight-pages long and includes best-practice recommendations on both _what_ to do and _why_ to do so.   

[The Well-Grounded Java Developer, Second Edition by Martijn Verburg, Benjamin Evans, and Jason Clark](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-well-grounded-java/9781617298875/)   
This is another excellent resource that's conducive to group discussion. I led a department-wide discussion of selected chapters from this book. Published in November 2022, this book contains information on more recent developments in the Java platform through Java 17. It contains an entire chapter on the Java Platform Module System (JPMS), one whole chapter on the new features in Java 17, three chapters on concurrency, and a few chapters on alternative JVM languages (Kotlin and Clojure).

[Parallel and Concurrent Programming with Java by Olivia Chiu Stone and Barron Stone](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/parallel-and-concurrent-programming-with-java-1)   
This is a two-part LinkedIn Learning video course. It is, surprisingly, as entertaining as it is informative! The husband-and-wife pair interact in fun and memorable ways, introducing key concurrency concepts and relevant Java APIs in relatable, accessible ways. (I have yet to complete the second part of this series.)

[Java™ Puzzlers: Traps, Pitfalls, and Corner Cases](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/java-puzzlers-traps/032133678X/)   
This book contains ninety-five puzzles from nine different categories (such as loops, exceptions, and strings). The puzzles challenge readers to think carefully about the ins and outs of the Java language. They serve as fun, stimulating icebreakers for team standups.

## Python
[NumPy Essential Training: 1 Foundations of NumPy by Terezija Semenski](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/numpy-essential-training-1-foundations-of-numpy)   
This video course on LinkedIn Learning is less than ninety minutes long, but is packed with helpful, introductory information on the basics of NumPy. The teacher is clear and methodical. The subsequent course, [NumPy Essential Training: 2 MatPlotlib and Linear Algebra Capabilities](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/numpy-essential-training-2-matplotlib-and-linear-algebra-capabilities), introduces additional material that builds on the basics.

[Effective Serialization with Python by Miki Tebeka](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/effective-serialization-with-python)   
This is another helpful LinkedIn Learning course. The instructor introduces serialization techniques for a number of more- and less-popular formats that are especially applicable in different contexts. These include protobuf, JSON, YAML, and pickle.   

## Databases
**Database Foundations series by Adam Wilbert**   
This series of courses on LinkedIn Learning is amazing. I'm so glad that this was available to me when I first started learning relational databases. (The instructor started releasing these courses in November 2020, and I found and started completing them a few months later.) I've completed a few dozen courses on LinkedIn Learning, and this series is definitely among the best on the platform. The content is very well paced within the whole series and within each course. The instructor is clear and thorough in describing concepts and in providing what learners need to succeed. The series includes these indvidual courses:
- [Database Foundations: Intro to Databases](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/database-foundations-intro-to-databases)
- [Database Foundations: Data Structures](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/database-foundations-data-structures)
- [Database Foundations: Database Management](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/database-foundations-database-management)
- [Database Foundations: Administration](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/database-foundations-administration-8375189)
- [Database Foundations: Application Development](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/database-foundations-application-development)   

[PostgreSQL: Client Applications by Adam Wilbert](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/postgresql-client-applications/work-with-postgresql-on-the-command-line)   
This is an in-depth exploration of psql on LinkedIn Learning by the author of the Database Foundations series. In addition to providing a review of basic psql usage, the instructor helps learners streamline their use of psql through customization, and he highlights a few advanced configurations that early intermediate psql users would otherwise overlook. He also expounds on the best ways to use pg_dump and pg_restore with various parameters.

[Learning JDBC by Frank P Moley III](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-jdbc)   
This LinkedIn Learning course is a helpful introduction to the Java Database Connectivity API. The course includes information on the basics of using PreparedStatement and CallableStatement along with ordering and limiting results, paging, connection pooling, and a whole section on handling transactions.

## General/Other
[Designing RESTful APIs by Keith Casey](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/designing-restful-apis)   
In this LinkedIn Learning course, the instructor introduces and discusses best practices for REST API design. He shares insights concerning basic design considerations including appropriate endpoint names, HTTP methods, and URL parameters. He also spends some time explaining how to version and update a REST API.   

[Web Security: OAuth and OpenID Connect by Keith Casey](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/web-security-oauth-and-openid-connect-2)   
"On the surface, OAuth looks complicated, but if you look just below the surface," Keith Casey says, "you'll realize it's still complicated!" He distinguishes and clearly defines authorization and authentication, illustrating the concepts with an analogy of checking into a hotel: Sharing your ID at the front desk upon check-in is analogous to the authentication process, and the issuing of the hotel key card represents authorization as the card grants access to the guest's room and to other areas of the hotel. The instructor goes into detail about other foundational concepts and definitions, JWT token validation, and the various possible grant types. He discusses the pros and cons of the different grant types, and shares recommendations on when to use each.   

[Introduction to Linux by Scott Simpson](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-linux)   
The instructor of this LinkedIn Learning course made Linux much more accessible than it would have been to me without this brief introduction when I first started using Linux occasionally a few years ago. The course is less than an hour long, but contains a lot of background information and general context to help new Linux users get acclimated. One of the most valuable aspects of this course is that the instructor encourages new users to make regular use of the `man` command to get information about commands.

[React Key Concepts by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/react-key-concepts/9781803234502/)   
I'm currently halfway through this book and really appreciate it so far. The author presents the most essential features of React and JSX in a systematic, incremental way. Each chapter builds off of the previous chapter at a pace that is neither too fast nor too slow.

## Networking
[Networking Foundations: Networking Basics (2015) by Timothy Pintello](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/networking-foundations-networking-basics-2015)   
[Networking Foundations: IP Addressing (2015) by Timothy Pintello](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/networking-foundations-ip-addressing-2015)   
[Networking Foundations: Servers (2016) by Ed Liberman](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/networking-foundations-servers-2016)   
I took these LinkedIn Learning courses a few years ago when my focus was on tech support. They provided a strong foundation in the basics of tech support that I needed at the time.   

[CompTIA Network+ (N10-007) Cert Prep: 1 Understanding Networks by Mike Meyers](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/comptia-network-plus-n10-007-cert-prep-1-understanding-networks)   
[CompTIA Network+ (N10-007) Cert Prep: 2 The Physical Network by Mike Meyers](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/comptia-network-plus-n10-007-cert-prep-2-the-physical-network)   
[CompTIA Network+ (N10-007) Cert Prep: 3 The World of TCP/IP by Mike Meyers](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/comptia-network-plus-n10-007-cert-prep-3-the-world-of-tcp-ip)   
[CompTIA Network+ (N10-007) Cert Prep: 4 Making TCP/IP Work by Mike Meyers](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/comptia-network-plus-n10-007-cert-prep-4-making-tcp-ip-work)   
These LinkedIn Learning courses are more in-depth than the Networking Foundations series. I didn't take the CompTIA Network+ exam, but these courses provided a whole lot of practical information that I was able to immediately put to use.
